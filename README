Does this actually work?

Considering the button on the GitHub website for preventing a workflow from
being disabled hits

  https://github.com/{user}/{repo}/actions/workflows/{workflow_id}/enable

which appears to be the analogue of the API we call: it hopefully does.

We'll see in another two months.
